I am a researcher in the deep learning group, Microsoft Research. Previously, I was a senior research scientist in Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab working on speech recognition and a senior member of research staff in the Voleon Group working on machine learning for trading. I am interested in graphical models, deep learning and their applications to speech, translation and natural language understanding.
